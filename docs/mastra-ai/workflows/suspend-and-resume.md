# Suspend & Resume

Workflows can be paused at any step to collect additional data, wait for API callbacks, throttle costly operations, or request [human-in-the-loop](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/human-in-the-loop) input. When a workflow is suspended, its current execution state is saved as a snapshot. You can later resume the workflow from a [specific step ID](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/snapshots#retrieving-snapshots), restoring the exact state captured in that snapshot. [Snapshots](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/snapshots) are stored in your configured storage provider and across deployments and application restarts.

## Pausing a workflow with `suspend()`

Use `suspend()` to pause workflow execution at a specific step. You can define a suspend condition in the step's `execute` block using values from `resumeData`.

- If the condition isn't met, the workflow pauses and returns `suspend()`.
- If the condition is met, the workflow continues with the remaining logic in the step.

**src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts**
```typescript
const step1 = createStep({
  id: "step-1",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    userEmail: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  }),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    approved: z.boolean()
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, resumeData, suspend }) => {
    const { userEmail } = inputData;
    const { approved } = resumeData ?? {};

    if (!approved) {
      return await suspend({});
    }

    return {
      output: `Email sent to ${userEmail}`
    };
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    userEmail: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

## Restarting a workflow with `resume()`

Use `resume()` to restart a suspended workflow from the step where it paused. To satisfy the step's suspend condition, pass a value using `resumeData` that matches the step's `resumeSchema`, allowing execution to continue from the suspended step.

```typescript
const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

await run.start({
  inputData: {
    userEmail: "alex@example.com"
  }
});

const handleResume = async () => {
  const result = await run.resume({
    step: 'step-1',
    resumeData: { approved: true }
  });
};
```

You can resume a suspended workflow using different triggers, including [human input](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/human-in-the-loop), external events from your application, or time-based conditions.

```typescript
const handleResume = async () => {
  const result = await run.resume({
    step: 'step-1',
    resumeData: { approved: true }
  });
};

const midnight = new Date();
midnight.setUTCHours(24, 0, 0, 0);
setTimeout(handleResume, midnight.getTime() - Date.now());
```

## Identifying suspended executions

When a workflow is suspended, it restarts from the step where it paused. You can check the workflow's `status` to confirm it's suspended, and use `suspended` to identify the paused step or [nested workflow](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview#workflows-as-steps).

```typescript
const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    userEmail: "alex@example.com"
  }
});

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  console.log(result.suspended[0]);
  await run.resume({
    step: result.suspended[0],
    resumeData: { approved: true }
  });
}
```

**Example output**

The `suspended` array contains the IDs of any suspended workflows and steps from the run. These can be passed to the `step` parameter when calling `resume()` to target and resume the suspended execution path.

```
[ 'nested-workflow', 'step-1' ]
```

## Sleep & Events

Sleep and event methods can be used to pause execution at the workflow level, which sets the status to `waiting`. By comparison, `suspend()` pauses execution within a specific step and sets the status to `suspended`.

**Available methods:**

- [`.sleep()`](https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sleep): Pause for a specified number of milliseconds
- [`.sleepUntil()`](https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sleepUntil): Pause until a specific date
- [`.waitForEvent()`](https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/waitForEvent): Pause until an external event is received
- [`.sendEvent()`](https://mastra.ai/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sendEvent): Send an event to resume a waiting workflow
